        <h3>Overview of MBTI Theory</h3>
        <p>Swiss psychologist Carl Jung believed that perception and judgment are the two fundamental functions of the mind. The moment the mind makes a decision can be broken down into two stages: the perception stage (which is further divided into sensing and intuitive perception) and the judgment stage (which is further divided into feeling and thinking judgment).</p>
        <img src="images/op1.png" alt="">
        <p>For ease of understanding, we can intuitively imagine the process of the mind making a decision as follows: (after the brain acquires information) sensing perception — intuitive perception — feeling judgment — thinking judgment, and finally making a decision. However, please remember that in reality, this process is interwoven and occurs in an instant, rather than in the simple linear sequence imagined.</p>
        <img src="images/op2.png" alt="">
        <p>Although everyone’s mind goes through these four stages when making a decision, the degree of inclination toward each stage can vary among individuals (which can also be understood as differing durations of focus). Some people may tend to linger more in the sensing perception stage and quickly pass through intuitive perception, while others may spend more time in feeling judgment and quickly move through thinking judgment. Additionally, these two fundamental functions of the mind are also influenced by individual sources of energy and lifestyle differences (as proposed by American psychologist Katherine Cook Briggs), leading to a wide variety of final decisions.</p>
        <p>After years of practice and continuous refinement, Jung’s personality classification theory has become the theoretical foundation for data-supported personality classification models internationally.</p>
