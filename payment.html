            People with the ENFJ personality type (Protagonists) feel called to serve a greater purpose in life.
            Thoughtful and idealistic, ENFJs strive to have a positive impact on other people and the world around them.
            These personalities rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, even when doing so is far
            from easy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="something">
            ENFJ personalities are genuine, caring people who talk the talk and walk the walk. Nothing makes them
            happier than motivating others to do what’s right.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="something">
            People with this personality type are devoted altruists, ready to face slings and arrows in order to stand
            up
            for the people and ideas that they believe in. This strength of conviction bolsters an ENFJ’s ability to
            guide others to work together in service of the greater good.

                But getting involved in other people’s problems isn’t always a recipe for success. ENFJs tend to have a
                clear
                vision of what people can or should do in order to better themselves, but not everyone is ready to make
                those changes. If they push too hard, their loved ones may feel resentful or unfairly judged. And while
                this
                personality type is known for being insightful, even the wisest ENFJs may sometimes misread a situation
                or
                unwittingly give bad advice.
